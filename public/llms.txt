# USD.AI

> USD.AI is a DeFi lending protocol that provides debt financing for AI infrastructure (GPUs). Depositors mint USDai (a synthetic dollar fully-backed by PayPal's PYUSD) or hold sUSDai (a yield-bearing token targeting 10-15% APR). Yield is generated through loans collateralized by GPU hardware deployed in data centers. The protocol's governance token is CHIP.

USD.AI structures credit for AI infrastructure by issuing asset-backed loans to data center operators, collateralized by GPU hardware (primarily NVIDIA H100/H200 clusters). Borrowers form bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicles (SPVs), contribute 20-30% equity, and USD.AI provides 70-80% loan-to-value (LTV) as secured debt.

The protocol has two core tokens:

- **USDai**: A synthetic dollar fully-backed by PayPal's PYUSD redeemable at par. Does not earn yield. Provides deep secondary market liquidity across DeFi and CeFi.
- **sUSDai**: The yield-bearing counterpart to USDai. Backed by AI infrastructure loan assets. Targets 10-15% APR. Subject to 30-day redemption cycles. Now fully insured by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer.

All collateral for USDai and sUSDai is held in Treasury Bills as base yield. The protocol uses the CALIBER credit framework for loan underwriting and risk assessment.

Primary borrowers are institutional-scale operators (e.g., Qumulus AI, Quantum, Sharon AI) spending $25M-$500M+ on GPU hardware. USD.AI is the leading InfraFi protocol.
